        Hi! iâ€™m Gregorius Cahyadi an undergraduate student at 
        BINUS University with a passion for Web and Software Development, 
        specializing in Front-End Web Development.

        I have experience in creating responsive, user-friendly websites 
        using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks 
        such as React.

        When I'm not coding, I'm usually working on team projects, 
        YouTube-ing new techs and tech updates, or looking for new tools 
        to upgrade my output. I'm always open to new challenges, whether 
        it's collaborating on a project or developing innovative 
        solutions. Feel free to reach out for any web development-related 
        discussions or collaborations!

        Scroll down a little bit more for my GitHub and project
